# Galapagos Music Box!

This is the music box and cloud light controller for Camp Galapagos.

Send hangout music to: https://www.dropbox.com/request/ghDTFcqiAavbZIsyFyb3

Please connect the music box to the cloud light Arduino via a USB cable.

Probably don't use the 1/8" audio jack on the Raspberry Pi, it's noisy. Would 
recommend the HDMI to audio converter instead.
